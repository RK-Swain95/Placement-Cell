# Placement-Cell


Team Career Camp wants to maintain a database of all the student interviews [only for their own
use], for this they store the following details:
- Batch
- Student Details (including college, status: [placed, not_placed])
- Course Scores (including DSA Final Score, WebD Final Score, React Final Score)
- Interviews (including company name and Date)
- Results (this is a mapping between company, and student, contains result: [PASS, FAIL, On
Hold, Didnâ€™t Attempt])

- Pages
- Sign Up and Sign In only for employees
- List of students + add new student (this is similar to adding and viewing posts in codeial)
- List of Interviews + form to create an interview (with date)
- Allocate a student to an interview
- Select an interview to view the list of all students and mark a result status from the list
page itself
